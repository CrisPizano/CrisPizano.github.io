        How do I cancel ?
    </h2>
    <pre>
Although we are terribly sad to see you go, we make canceling your membership as easy as possible. 
If you can make it in the club, we'd love to see you one more time for a final goodbye M-F from 8am-8pm or Saturdays from 8am-2pm. 
If you can't make it in, log-on to your member portal online to process your cancelation, visit: www.mypxmclubonline.com.
Your agreement should be out of term and in good standing in order to cancel, please provide a 14 day notice.
